STAT 771 (F16) Final Project - Bandwidth selection for univariate kernel density estimation


Final project for STAT 771 - Statistical Computing. Investigated four common bandwidth selection strategies and compared hat(f) across different data vectors. Wrote function `kde` to compute and display kernel density estimates.
