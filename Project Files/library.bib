abstract = {There has been major progress in recent years in data-based bandwidth selection for kernel density estimation. Some “second generation” methods, including plug-in and smoothed bootstrap techniques, have been developed that are far superior to well-known “first generation” methods, such as rules of thumb, least squares cross-validation, and biased cross-validation. We recommend a “solve-the-equation” plug-in bandwidth selector as being most reliable in terms of overall performance. This article is intended to provide easy accessibility to the main ideas for nonexperts.},

@article{Jones1992,
abstract = {We review the extensive recent literature on automatic, data-based selection of a global smoothing parameter in univariate kernel density estimation. Proposals are presented in a unified framework, making considerable reference to their theoretical properties as we go. The results of a major simulation study of the practical performance of many of these methods are summarised. Also, our remarks are further consolidated by describing a small portion of our practical experience on real datasets. Our comparison of methods' practical performance demonstrates that improvements to be gained by using the better methods can be, and often are, considerable. It will be seen that achieving optimal theoretical performance (up to bounds derived by Hall and Marron, 1991) and acceptable practical performance is not accomplished by the same techniques. We put much effort into making good practical choices whenever options arise. We emphasise that arguably the two best known bandwidth selection methods cannot be advocated for general practical use; these are ''least squares cross-validation'' (which suffers from too much variability) and normal-based ''rules-of-thumb'' (which are too biased towards oversmoothing). A number of methods that do seem to be worthy of further consideration are listed. We show why our overall current preference is for the method of Sheather and Jones (1991). It is hoped that the lessons learned in this comparatively simple setting will also prove useful in many other smoothing situations.},

@article{Terrell1990,
abstract = {Abstract We propose a widely applicable method for choosing the smoothing parameters for nonparametric density estimators. It has come to be realized in recent years (e.g., see Hall and Marron 1987; Scott and Terrell 1987) that cross-validation methods for finding reasonable smoothing parameters from raw data are of very limited practical value. Their sampling variability is simply too large. The alternative discussed here, the maximal smoothing principle, suggests that we consider using the most smoothing that is consistent with the estimated scale of our data. This greatly generalizes and exploits a phenomenon noted in Terrell and Scott (1985), that measures of scale tend to place upper bounds on the smoothing parameters that minimize asymptotic mean integrated squared error of density estimates such as histograms and frequency polygons. The method avoids the extreme sampling variability of cross-validation by using ordinary scale estimators such as the standard deviation and interquartile range, which ...},

abstract = {The accuracy of the binned kernel density estimator is studied for general binning rules. We derive mean squared error results for the closeness of this estimator to both the true density and the unbinned kernel estimator. The binning rule and smoothness of the kernel function are shown to influence the accuracy of the binned kernel estimators. Our results are used to compare commonly used binning rules, and to determine the minimum grid size required to obtain a given level of accuracy.},

@article{Husak2007,
abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},
